# RAFIQ â€” Frontend Prototype (Large Bundle)

This archive contains a large, fully client-side frontend prototype for the RAFIQ project.
It simulates the Child Session, Therapist Dashboard, Admin CMS and an AI Lab using only
HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no backend). Data is stored in localStorage.

How to use:
1. Unzip the folder and open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
2. Use `login.html` to simulate different roles.
3. Start child sessions, save them, and open the dashboard to view charts.

Files are under `/mnt/data/rafiq-big-frontend` and a zip archive `rafiq-big-frontend.zip` is provided.
